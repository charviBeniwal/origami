    <h2> Interesting Facts about camel</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> The word ‘camel’ comes from an Arabic word, when it’s literally translated, it means beauty. Don’t ever try
            and say that camels are ugly!</li>
        <li>They need to stay hydrated in the desert, so it’s no surprise that camels can drink as much as 40 gallons of
            water at once. Considering it’s not being stored in their humps, that’s pretty amazing.</li>
        <li>During the Second World War, German tank drivers would drive their vehicles over camel droppings, thinking
            it would bring them good luck.</li>
